This is a project to develop an AI program that can learn to play games

The concept used was inspired by neural networks. I wanted to see if a 
design that was more similar to the actual structure of brains would be 
capable of the same success that we see with neural networks today.

These networks are made up of neurons that resemble those in nervous systems.
They have charge and a critical point of charge buildup where they release a pulse
of charge to the neurons they connect to. Specific neurons are selected as inputs and 
outputs. So far inputs have to be of binary values and they determine whether or not 
thoses neurons fire at the beginning of processing. If any output neurons fire then
that is given as the output of processing.
